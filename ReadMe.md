I have uploaded the eclipse workspace.
To run in eclipse:
-- Import the project into workspace.
-- Give the input as "teamX.txt" in the runConfiguration.
-- Click run, you can see the output on console.
To run in console
--Copy the .java files in EliminationProblem/src into a folder
--Execute the command as "java EliminationProblem.java test10.txt""
